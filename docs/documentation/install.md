# Install

<p class="lead">How to deploy and run CatalogueCanvas. Docker is the recommended path.</p>

## Requirements

- **Docker + Docker Compose** (recommended).
- For local development without Docker:
    - Python 3.11+ and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (backend)
    - Node.js 22+ (frontend)

### Footprint

- Docker image: ~436 MB
- RAM: ~256 MB for light use
- Disc: scales with uploaded assets — size the data volume accordingly
- CPU: a single core is sufficient

## Quick start (Docker)

<p class="lead">Docker builds the image, generates a session key, and keeps your data in a volume. This is the recommended way to run CatalogueCanvas.</p>

### Before you start

- **Docker + Docker Compose** installed and running.
- The CatalogueCanvas source, which ships the `docker-compose.yml`:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ToroRojo-code/CatalogueCanvas.git
    cd CatalogueCanvas
    ```

### Steps

<ol class="steps" markdown>
<li markdown>
Start the app, passing an admin password. The first run builds the image, so it takes a little longer:

```bash
CC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword docker compose up --build
```

</li>
<li markdown>
Wait for the log line that says the server is listening on port `8000`.
</li>
<li markdown>
Open `http://localhost:8000` and log in with the password you set in `CC_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
</li>
</ol>

To run it in the background instead, add `-d`:

```bash
CC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword docker compose up --build -d
```

Stop it with `docker compose down` (your data volume is kept).

### Using a `.env` file

Setting more than one variable on the command line gets awkward. Docker Compose reads a file
named `.env` in the same directory as `docker-compose.yml`, so you can keep your configuration
there instead.

<ol class="steps" markdown>
<li markdown>
Create a `.env` file next to `docker-compose.yml`:

```ini
# .env — CatalogueCanvas configuration
CC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword
CC_PORT=8000
CC_SITE_TITLE=My Catalogue
CC_SITE_AUTHOR=Your Name
```

Add any other variables from [Configuration](#configuration) as `KEY=value` lines.
</li>
<li markdown>
Start the app. Compose reads `.env`, so you do not repeat the variables:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

</li>
</ol>

!!! warning "Keep `.env` out of version control"

    The file holds your admin password. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` so it is never committed.

!!! note "Editors"

    Confirm Compose interpolation against the shipped `docker-compose.yml` — whether each `CC_*`
    variable is referenced as `${CC_...}` (so `.env` flows through to the container) or passed via
    `env_file:`. Verify before publishing.

### What happens on first start

??? question "Where does my data live?"
    All data — the SQLite database and every uploaded asset — persists in the `cc-data` Docker
    volume, mounted at `/data` inside the container. Removing the container does not delete it;
    `docker compose down -v` does. To keep data in a directory you control instead, see
    [Home-server install](#home-server-install).

??? question "Do I need to generate a secret key?"
    No. The **session signing key is generated automatically** on first start and saved to
    `/data/cc_secret_key.txt` in the data volume, then reused on every restart. There is no
    manual key-generation or `secrets/` step. Set `CC_SECRET_KEY` or `CC_SECRET_KEY_FILE` only
    if you want to supply your own.

??? question "Which port does it use, and how do I change it?"
    The container always listens on `8000`. The host port is mapped from `CC_PORT` (default
    `8000`). To serve on, say, port `9000`:

    ```bash
    CC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword CC_PORT=9000 docker compose up --build
    ```

??? question "How do I set the site title or author?"
    Pass them as environment variables on the same command:

    ```bash
    CC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword \
    CC_SITE_TITLE="My Catalogue" \
    CC_SITE_AUTHOR="Your Name" \
    docker compose up --build
    ```

    See [Configuration](#configuration) for the full list of variables.

!!! warning "Login fails silently?"

    If you cannot log in, check that `CC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` was set on the command that started the
    container — it is required. See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for other causes.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | _(empty)_ | Admin login password — required to log in |
| `CC_PORT` | `8000` | Host port mapped to the container (the container always listens on 8000) |
| `CC_SECRET_KEY_FILE` | `<CC_DATA_DIR>/cc_secret_key.txt` | Path to the session signing key. Auto-generated and persisted on first start; only set this to override the location |
| `CC_SECRET_KEY` | _(unset)_ | Session signing key as an env var — optional override; if neither this nor the key file is set, a key is generated automatically |
| `CC_SITE_TITLE` | `My Catalogue` | Title shown in the UI and on public portfolios |
| `CC_SITE_AUTHOR` | _(empty)_ | Author/owner name shown on public portfolios |
| `CC_DATA_DIR` | `/data` | Base directory for the database and storage |
| `CC_DB_PATH` | `<CC_DATA_DIR>/catalogue.db` | SQLite database file path |
| `CC_STORAGE_DIR` | `<CC_DATA_DIR>/storage` | Directory for uploaded item assets |
| `CC_STATIC_DIR` | `web/dist` | Directory of built frontend assets to serve |
| `CC_LLM_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | _(unset)_ | Comma-separated hostnames/IPs the Describe feature may call. Unset = no restriction. Set to protect against SSRF (e.g. `ollama.lan,192.168.1.50`) |

!!! note "Editors"

    Verify this table against `server/src/cataloguecanvas/settings.py` before publishing.

## Local development (without Docker)

**Backend:**

```bash
cd server
uv sync
uv run uvicorn cataloguecanvas.main:app --reload
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd web
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server proxies API requests to the backend (see `web/vite.config.ts`).

## Home-server install

<p class="lead">Running CatalogueCanvas on a machine you keep on your home network: a NAS, a mini-PC, or a Raspberry Pi.</p>

This is the same Docker path as the quick start, set up for a box that stays on rather than your laptop.

<ol class="steps" markdown>
<li markdown>
Pick a directory on the host for persistent data and point the data volume at it, so your database and assets live outside the container:

```bash
mkdir -p /srv/cataloguecanvas/data
```

</li>
<li markdown>
Start it with the data directory bind-mounted and a restart policy so it comes back after a reboot:

```bash
CC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword docker compose up -d
```

<!-- TODO Editors: confirm the compose file exposes a restart policy (e.g. `restart: unless-stopped`) and a bind mount for /srv/cataloguecanvas/data. Document the exact compose override here. -->
</li>
<li markdown>Reach it from another device on the LAN at `http://<server-ip>:8000`.</li>
</ol>

!!! note "Editors"

    TODO, reconcile against the app before publishing: exposing the service on a LAN, putting it behind a reverse proxy (Caddy / Nginx / Traefik) for a hostname and TLS, and any ARM/Raspberry Pi image notes. **Do not** recommend exposing this to the public internet. The FAQ already warns against it.

## Advanced: bare-metal install (no Docker)

<p class="lead">Running the backend and frontend directly on the host, without containers. You manage the process and its environment yourself.</p>

!!! warning

    This path is unsupported. Docker is the recommended deployment. You manage the process manager, reverse proxy, and updates yourself.

    ```

??? question "Windows (no Docker, no WSL)"
    Tested end to end on Windows 11. The Docker entrypoint does not run here, so you set a few environment variables by hand that Docker would otherwise set for you (see **Run it** below).

    **Prerequisites** (install once via `winget`)

    - [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/) (ships with Windows 11)
    - Node.js LTS to build the frontend
    - [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python and the backend dependencies. It downloads its own CPython, so you do not need a separate Python install.
    - `git`, or download a source release ZIP instead

    **Step by step**

    ```bat
    :: 1. Toolchain via winget
    winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS astral-sh.uv Git.Git

    :: 2. Get the source (open a fresh terminal so PATH updates)
    git clone https://github.com/ToroRojo-code/CatalogueCanvas.git
    cd CatalogueCanvas

    :: 3. Build the frontend
    cd web
    npm ci
    npm run build

    :: 4. Sync backend dependencies
    cd ..\server
    uv sync
    ```

    !!! warning "SVG previews need Cairo"

        On a stock Windows machine, ingesting an item whose preview is an **SVG** fails with HTTP 500 until the native **Cairo** library is installed. Raster previews (PNG/JPEG/TIFF), browsing, and login are unaffected.

        On **x64**, get Cairo from the [Cairo download page](https://cairographics.org/download/). The Windows binaries come with the GTK runtime: install an x64 GTK runtime, or grab the cairo, zlib, and libpng run-time archives directly and put `libcairo-2.dll` (with `zlib1.dll` and `libpng`) on `PATH`, then restart the server.

        On **Windows ARM64**, Cairo needs the MSYS2 toolchain instead.
        <!-- TODO Editors: port the "SVG rendering on Windows ARM64" section from inputdoc/cataloguecanvas-features.md if ARM64 support is in scope for the docs. -->

### Run it

Once built, run the backend as a long-lived process. Leave off `--reload`, and set the required environment variables.

On Linux and macOS:

```bash
CC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword \
CC_DATA_DIR=/srv/cataloguecanvas/data \
uv run uvicorn cataloguecanvas.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

On Windows, set the variables the Docker entrypoint would normally set. A `run-cc.bat` keeps it in one place:

```bat
@echo off
cd /d C:\path\to\CatalogueCanvas\server
set CC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme
set CC_SECRET_KEY=<random-hex>
set CC_DATA_DIR=C:\Users\<you>\cc-data
set CC_COOKIE_SECURE=false
set CC_STATIC_DIR=C:\path\to\CatalogueCanvas\web\dist
uv run uvicorn cataloguecanvas.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`, or `http://<machine-ip>:8000` from another device on the LAN.

!!! danger "Windows over plain HTTP: set `CC_COOKIE_SECURE=false`"

    `CC_COOKIE_SECURE` defaults to `true`. Over plain HTTP (LAN or local testing) a secure cookie does not round-trip and **login silently fails** with no error. Set it to `false` when serving over HTTP. Generate `CC_SECRET_KEY` with `uv run python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`; without it, the bare-metal
    server falls back to an insecure default.

!!! note "Editors"

    TODO, reconcile against the app before publishing: confirm each OS's package names, the minimum versions, and the clone URL; the production process manager (a `systemd` unit or Windows Task Scheduler / NSSM example); running behind a reverse proxy for TLS; and the upgrade procedure (pull, rebuild frontend, `uv sync`, restart). Verify all env vars against `server/src/cataloguecanvas/settings.py`. The cross-platform backslash URL issue noted in the feature handover may also be worth a troubleshooting entry.

## Connecting a local LLM

If CatalogueCanvas runs in Docker and your LLM server (LM Studio, Ollama, …) runs on the host, point the API URL at the host bridge, **not** `localhost`:

```text
http://host.docker.internal:1234
```

`localhost` inside the container refers to the container itself.

The `/v1/chat/completions` path is **appended automatically** — you only need the host and port. A full URL still works if you prefer to supply one.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---|---|
| LLM request fails | Endpoint unreachable or misconfigured — the error now reports the actual cause (connection, HTTP error, non-JSON, or no choices returned). Check the API URL; use `host.docker.internal` from Docker |
| Can't log in | `CC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` not set; in multi-user mode every user's password must be unique; or 5 failed attempts triggered the 5-minute rate limit |
| Upload rejected | File isn't a `.zip`, or exceeds the configured max upload size |
