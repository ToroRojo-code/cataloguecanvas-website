# Admin documentation

<p class="lead">Configuration, storage, AI setup, backups, and operations.</p>

For everyday use (uploading, editing, portfolios), see [User documentation](user.md). For
deployment, see [Install](install.md).

## Access model

CatalogueCanvas can run in single-admin or **multi-user** mode, secured by passwords and a
session cookie.

- **Admin** — full access: upload, edit, organise, configure, and publish. All management
  screens require an authenticated admin session.
- **Reader** _(multi-user mode)_ — can view the whole catalogue and download files, but cannot
  modify anything; all admin-only menus and controls are hidden.
- **Public visitor** — no login; can only reach portfolios marked **Public**.

When multi-user mode is **on**, users sign in with a **username and password**, and the admin
and reader passwords must differ. When it is **off**, the original single-password admin login
is used. The signed-in username is shown next to the **Log out** button. Admins manage accounts
from the **Users** panel in Settings.

Security notes:

- Login is **rate-limited**: 5 failed attempts from one address in 5 minutes blocks further tries.
- Passwords are hashed (argon2); sessions use a signed cookie.
- The session signing key is generated automatically on first start and persisted at
  `<CC_DATA_DIR>/cc_secret_key.txt` — no manual setup required.
- Set a strong `CC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in production (and a distinct reader password if multi-user
  mode is enabled).

## Settings overview

The **Settings** page groups: Appearance, Users, LLM defaults, Prompt template, Libraries, and Backup & export.

### Appearance
Theme (light/dark), accent colour, navigation layout (top/side), density (airy/balanced/dense),
and enable/disable **Favourites**.

### Users
Enable **multi-user mode** and manage accounts. Each user has a username, a password, and a
role (Admin or Reader). The admin and reader passwords must differ. With multi-user mode off,
the instance uses the single-password admin login.

### LLM defaults

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| API URL | OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint |
| Model | Model name to call |
| Item type | What the items are (e.g. "image", "artwork") |
| Summary focus | What the description should emphasise |
| Bullet points | How many bullets to generate |
| Max words per bullet | Length cap per bullet |
| Generate description (LLM) | Whether the item editor offers a generate button |

### Prompt template
Edit the raw **TOML** prompt used to build the LLM request. Placeholders:
`{item_type}`, `{summary_focus}`, `{bullet_count}`, `{bullet_max_words}`. Includes a
**reset-to-default** option.

### Libraries (multi-storage)

- Add libraries pointing at different **writable directories** (e.g. a second disk).
    - Paths must already be **mounted into the container** and writable.
- Set any library as the **default** for new uploads.
- Constraints: a library's **path can't change** once it holds items; a library **can't be deleted**
  while it contains items or while it is the default.

### Backup & export

- **Database backup** — a single SQLite snapshot.
- **Full backup** — a ZIP of the database **plus every stored asset** across all libraries.
- Live stats shown: total items, total collections, items missing a preview.

## LLM / AI descriptions in depth

- Works with any **OpenAI-compatible vision LLM** — local (LM Studio, Ollama) or hosted.
- An **API key may be supplied per request** and is used **only for that request — never stored**.
  This also applies to **batch generation**: an optional API-key field is available when
  generating descriptions for many selected items at once.
- The API URL is **auto-completed** — enter just the host and port
  (e.g. `http://host.docker.internal:1234`) and `/v1/chat/completions` is appended; a full URL
  also works.
- **Reasoning is stripped** from results: `<think>` blocks and reasoning preambles from
  "thinking" models are removed, and the prompt requests a clean JSON-only response, so
  descriptions contain only the summary and bullet points.
- The request **timeout is 90 seconds**, to accommodate slower local models.
- Failures report the **actual cause** (connection, HTTP error, non-JSON, or no choices
  returned) rather than an opaque error.

## Findable metadata (FAIR)

- **Full-text search** covers every item's title, description/note, tags, and the full contents
  of its uploaded `metadata.json` / `metadata.toml`. Results are ranked by relevance, with prefix
  matching. Search is handled on the server.
- Each item exposes a **machine-readable metadata record** in **JSON-LD** (schema.org / Dublin
  Core) at `/api/items/{id}/metadata`, linked from the item page. The record uses the item's
  persistent ID as its identifier, maps title, description, and tags to standard terms, and
  carries the uploaded metadata as additional properties — so items are **findable and
  harvestable by external tools** (the "F" in FAIR).

## How items are stored (operator view)

- Each item lives under its library at `items/<item-id>/` with a `preview.webp` and an `other/` folder.
- **SVGs are LZ4-compressed** on disk. Compressed files are served **exactly as stored, as a
  download** — never decompressed or rendered in the browser. The WebP preview generated at
  ingestion remains the display image.
- Item IDs are unique `word-NNN` strings, checked against the database to avoid collisions.
- Items are **deduplicated by content hash** at ingest.

## Diagnostics

Admins can download a **redacted Markdown diagnostic report** from Settings (or generate it via
a CLI script) to attach to a GitHub issue. It covers:

- Versions and **build provenance** (git SHA and build date).
- **Masked** configuration (no secrets).
- Disk and storage usage.
- LLM configuration plus a **live endpoint reachability probe**.
- Database counts.
- A **storage-integrity check** (missing or orphaned files).

## Operations checklist

- [ ] Strong `CC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` set (and a distinct reader password in multi-user mode)
- [ ] Data volume sized for expected assets (it also holds the auto-generated session key)
- [ ] Library paths mounted and writable
- [ ] Regular backup routine in place
- [ ] `CC_SITE_TITLE` / `CC_SITE_AUTHOR` set for public portfolios
