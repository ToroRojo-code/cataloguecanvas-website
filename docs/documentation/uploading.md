# Uploading items

<p class="lead">Every portfolio starts with <strong>items</strong> — the individual works you catalogue in CatalogueCanvas. This guide covers adding files, the formats we support, and getting metadata right the first time.</p>

!!! info "Key Concept"

    A key concept in this software is that a piece of work being stored is together with their metadata. Those being the necesary files to reproduce that piece of work, a json files with settings, a pdf file, pictures...etc

## Upload from the dashboard

The dashboard is the fastest way to add a handful of items. Drag files straight onto the
dropzone, or browse from disc — CatalogueCanvas renders a preview plate for each one as it lands.

<ol class="steps" markdown>
<li markdown>Open the **Catalog** and click **Upload** in the top nav — or press <kbd>⌘</kbd> <kbd>U</kbd> from anywhere.</li>
<li markdown>Drag files onto the dropzone, or click **Browse** to pick them from disc.</li>
<li markdown>Wait for thumbnails to render. Large images and PDFs may take a moment to generate a cover plate.</li>
<li markdown>Click **Save to catalog**. New items land in your default collection, ready to tag.</li>
</ol>

<div class="plate-ph" data-label="screenshot · dropzone (drag state)"></div>

## LLM integration

CatalogueCanvas can describe an item's preview image with any **OpenAI-compatible vision LLM** — local (LM Studio, Ollama, llama.cpp) or hosted. Set the defaults once in **Settings → LLM defaults**, then generate a description from an item's page or in bulk across a selection.

<ol class="steps" markdown>
<li markdown>In **Settings → LLM defaults**, set the **API URL** and **model**. You can enter just the host and port (e.g. `http://host.docker.internal:1234`) — the `/v1/chat/completions` path is appended automatically.</li>
<li markdown>Tune the output: **item type**, **summary focus**, number of **bullet points**, and **max words per bullet**.</li>
<li markdown>On an item, click **Generate description (LLM)**, review the result, and **apply it to your notes**.</li>
<li markdown>These notes are searchable, and editable. Rendered in markdown format[^format] </li>

</ol>

!!! tip "API keys are never stored"

    An API key can be supplied **per request** — for a single item or for a bulk run — and is
    used only for that request, never saved. Hosted endpoints that require a key work the same
    way as keyless local servers.

!!! note "Running in Docker?"

    If CatalogueCanvas runs in a container and your LLM server runs on the host, point the API
    URL at `http://host.docker.internal:<port>` — `localhost` inside the container refers to the
    container itself. Reasoning from "thinking" models is stripped from results, and the request
    timeout is 90 seconds to allow for slower local models.

For full configuration and troubleshooting, see [Admin documentation → LLM / AI descriptions](admins.md).

## Supported file types

Most creative formats are catalogued natively. Anything we can't preview is still stored
safely and shown with a generic plate.

| Kind | Extensions | Max size | Preview |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Image** | `jpg · png · webp · tiff` | 50 MB | Thumbnail auto-generated |
| **Vector** | `svg · ai · eps` | 25 MB | Rasterised at import |
| **Document** | `pdf · docx` | 25 MB | First page as cover plate |
| **Other** | `zip · any` | 200 MB | Stored as-is, generic plate |

## Add metadata

Good metadata is what makes a catalogue searchable later. Each item carries a **title**, an
auto-assigned `ID`, free-form **tags**, and an optional **note**. You can edit any field inline
from the item view, or in bulk from the catalogue grid.

!!! tip "Tip"

    Keep tag casing consistent. Search is case-insensitive, but tag chips render exactly as
    typed — `Mono` and `mono` will look like two different tags in a portfolio.

## Import metadata in bulk

Cataloguing a large archive? Upload the files first, then attach metadata from a CSV. Match rows
to items by `id`; any column you omit is left untouched.

```csv title="catalog-import.csv"
id,title,tags,note
CC-0184,"Aperture Study","print,mono","Test plate, archived"
CC-0185,"Grid No. 7","poster","Final, client-approved"
CC-0186,"Cyan Field","experiment,color",""
```

Then open **Bulk actions → Import metadata** and drop the file. A preview shows exactly which
items will change before you commit.

<figure markdown>
  ![Batch metadata CSV settings](../assets/sc_BatchMetadata_CatalogueCanvas.png)
  <figcaption>Settings → Batch metadata (CSV) — export, re-import, and per-import backups</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="keys" markdown>
<kbd>⌘</kbd> <kbd>U</kbd> Upload &nbsp;·&nbsp; <kbd>/</kbd> Search catalogue &nbsp;·&nbsp; <kbd>⌘</kbd> <kbd>Enter</kbd> Save changes &nbsp;·&nbsp; <kbd>Esc</kbd> Close panel
</div>

## Troubleshooting

!!! warning "Upload stalls or fails"

    If a file hangs at "processing", it usually exceeds the size limit for its type or uses an
    unsupported codec. Re-export at a smaller size, or store it as a `zip` to keep it in the
    catalogue without a preview.

    Still stuck? Check your connection and retry — partial uploads resume automatically for up
    to 24 hours.
